-Instructions on how to run the project. 

-Unzipping the zip file should allow you to run the project without 
having to install anything.

-The way to run the project is by opening up a new terminal in your preffered IDE and 
running "npm run devStart" within the "Music_Project" directory.

-Once that is done, you will be informed through the terminal that it is "starting 'node server.js'"

-Then, the next step is to go to your preffered browser and type in "localhost:5000" in the url seach bar 
and enter, it will then open the project for you.

-Functionality wise, I doubt you need much help, clicking the buttons is enough however for the record button,
to record you need to click the button and to stop recording you need to click the same button.

-Enjoy our piano!!!
